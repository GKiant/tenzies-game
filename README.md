# 19-tenzies-game
Tenzies is a popular dice game that I adapted into a web application
built with React.js. In this game, player roll ten dice and aim to get
as many of the same number as possible. Each round, player choose which
dice to keep and which to re-roll, with the goal of getting ten dices of
the same value in the least amount of rounds possible.
The React.js implementation of Tenzies provides a seamless and enjoyable
gaming experience, with smooth animations and intuitive user interface.
